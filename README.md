These are the working files used for my research project, "Predictions using hidden Markov models and stochastic context-free grammars".  Some were used as test files.  To see the final, cumulative code, see "dice example and plotted accuracies".

Included are also the paper itself, as well as the summary presentation, created using Beamer.
