Included are the working Python files used for my research project, "Predictions using hidden Markov models and stochastic context-free grammars".  Some were used as test files.  To see the final, cumulative code, see "dice example and plotted accuracies".  These simulated the "unfair casino" example given in the paper, taken from "Biological sequence analysis (probabilistic models of proteins and nucleic acids)" by Durbin, Eddy, Krogh and Mitchison.

Included are also the paper itself, as well as the summary presentation, created using Beamer.
